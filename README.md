This school project focused on creating an SQL database that tracks swimming information in the local Terre Haute community.

A Java graphics interface was created for two different types with a login for both users and admin. Data from D3 swimmers from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and local swim teams
was added into the database for usage and testing. Standard practices with Prepared Statements were used to connect the application to the SQL database.

The final test for the database was to create the database on a completely new server, so all stored procedures, table creations, function creations, and data importing wered saved and run
from scratch in a different server.
